## To create virtual environment
install Django, use the one compatible with your Python (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/faq/install/). <pip install Django>
in the terminal, type <py -m venv venv> to add venv folder ( this is the virtual environment folder)
Activate venv by typing <venv\Scripts\Activate>

## Why create a virtual environment
- You may have multiple Python versios on your computer
- You may have projects that rwquire different versions of same external package
- Virtual environments create a "workspace" environment for a specific projects
 - All installed apps are in one place, without conflicts
 - The "python" and "pip" commands point to the same place
 -  Keep your enviornment clean.

 ## Installing the requirements in the requirement.txt folder
 - use <pip install -r requirements.txt> # this will install all the requirement in the files

 ## Create a new folder
 - in the terminal <django-admin startproject Taofeek_test> # this will create a new file inside the intro-to-django folder
 - navigate into Taofeek.test folder <cd Taofeek_test>
 - Run ther vm server using <python manage.py runserver>
  - This will create a new file within Taofeek.test called db.sqlite3
  - You will also get some messages on the command screen
   -You have 18 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations for app(s): admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions.
   - Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.
   - March 11, 2025 - 09:58:19
   - Django version 4.2.20, using settings 'Taofeek_test.settings'
   - Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
   - Quit the server with CTRL-BREAK.
  - go to the port above and it should take you to django
  - Next go to the admin of the local host: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
  
  ## Initialize the development database
  -  <python manage.py migrate>
   - This will Initialize a SQLite database (db.sqlite3) with the tables specified in the default project:
    - Autorization table (user, permissions, groups)
    - django_migratations
    django_admins_log
    django_sessions
    django_content_type
 - To view the database, you can use website: https://inloop.github.io/sqlite-viewer/
 - you can also download VS Code extension
  - plugin:SQlite

  ## Create super username for admin login
  - <python manage.py createsuperuser>
  -Suppy the following
   - username: Admin
   - email address: Sanyaolutaofeek@yahoo.com
   - password (u can bypass the pasword requirements):

## login to django administration
-  go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/login/?next=/admin/ and login

if you type python manage.py without any extension, it gives you list of available commands
Type 'manage.py help <subcommand>' for help on a specific subcommand.

Available subcommands:

[auth]
    changepassword
    createsuperuser

[contenttypes]
    remove_stale_contenttypes

[django]
    check
    compilemessages
    createcachetable
    dbshell
    diffsettings
    dumpdata
    flush
    inspectdb
    loaddata
    makemessages
    makemigrations
    migrate
    optimizemigration
    sendtestemail
    shell
    showmigrations
    sqlflush
    sqlmigrate
    sqlsequencereset
    squashmigrations
    startapp
    startproject
    test
    testserver

[sessions]
    clearsessions

[staticfiles]
    collectstatic
    findstatic
    runserver

## Setting.py
-  this is where your seeting configuration is completed. 
- you need to set debug mode to off when in production
- you need to point to another DB like postgres in production instead of SQLite


## Creating a Django app (an example)
- Steps to create a Django app
	1. Create a new app using startapp
	2. Add it to settings
	3. Create a URL: add urls.py file to visit folder
	4. Link it to a view
	5. Return a template
	6. Make it dynamic with context
	7. Use data from a model
    8. Add some static files

You can do everything through manage.py and it will link to every other folders
- first navigate to Taofeek_test if the venv is already closed: cd Taofeek_text
- start the app using <python manage.py startapp visit> This will create a new folder called visit
-  in settings.py under Taofeek_test add the string path to new folder (visit) to setting under installed_app
 - add <visit.apps.VisitConfig> to settings
- Django use Install_apps as a list of places to look for models, management commands, tests, and other utilities.
- Create url by adding a new file to visit called urls.py
 - Add url pattern
- After editing the url in visit, you need to now connect it to the mail folder (Taofeek_test) urls.py

## Migrating to Database
- When you make a change in the model.py file, you need to run python manage.py makemigrations.
 - That will create a new file 0001_initial.py in the migration folder
 - When you confirm the file now exist, you can now migrate to database by typing <python manage.py migrate
 - The DB is now ready for any visit file you want to put in it.
  - python manage.py shell
  - This will open a python interactive section for DB while still having access to Django
  - The python, run the following
   - from visits.models import Visits
   - v = Viists() then enter
   -check databasw using v.count then enter (that should give you zero as nothing is saved at this time)
   - you can then save using v.save() then enter
   - using Visists.objects.all() you can query the database.
   - exit to get back to the terminal

   ## Editing the model using Admin
   1. register the Visista moel in admins.py
    - from sample file, copy admin.py and past in Visit admin.py
   
## Settings for personal 
- Setting provides configuration for your Djago project
- Default location is settings.py
 -  Python file, python syntax
 - setting are constants
 - Use all upercases
 - Reload server if any settings change
- Specify the location of your settings file
 - in manage.py
  - os..environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTING_MODULE', 'your_folder_name.settings')

### Must-Know settings in Django
1. debug: show detailed error page vs 404.html or 500.html
 - never set it to True in production
2. Installed_Apps
 - all Django. 3rd party an local apps used are set here.
2. Databases
 - Can configure multiple Databases
 - SHould be different from local, prodution, staging.
 Note: Django has a slight preference for postgres
3. Base_Dir
 - set to project root (where manage.py is located)
4. App_Dir
 - set to where apps are located
5. Templates
 - DIRS -Where to look for Templates
 -APP_DIRS - it True, look for a "templates" folder in each app
6. STaticFiles_DIRS
 - Where to look for static files
7. Use_TZ
 - True is dates/Times should be timezone-aware bu default
 - Should set to True
8. TIME_ZONE - Set to your time 
9. USE_I8N - Aneble text translation (Set to False if not supported)
 - USE_L10N - Format data based on locale

## Django ORM 
- Object-Relational Mapping
- Manage your data and database with Python instead of SQL 
- Lazy evaluation of queries (database only gets accessed when data is requested, not when forming queries)
- Define models with fields and relationships
-Create a migration file- $python manage.py 
- Migrate the database: $ python manage.py migrate

## Updating the Visit model by renaming the models.visits to visit
